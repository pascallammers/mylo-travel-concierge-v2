# Changelog

All notable changes to Droidz will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.2] - 2025-11-10

### Fixed
- **Critical: Custom droid architecture** - Fixed "Invalid tools: Task" error
  - Removed `Task` from orchestrator tools array (it's not a listable tool)
  - Changed orchestrator from delegator to planner role
  - Orchestrator now creates delegation instructions for USER to execute
  - Removed explicit `tools` arrays from specialist droids
  - When `tools` field is undefined, Factory provides ALL tools (Create, Edit, MultiEdit, ApplyPatch, etc.)
  - This works for ALL models: Claude (Sonnet/Opus/Haiku), GPT-5/GPT-5-Codex, GLM-4.6

### Added
- **TOOL_COMPATIBILITY.md** - Comprehensive guide on Factory's tool system
  - Explains tool categories and availability
  - Documents all supported models
  - Provides MCP enhancement options
  - Includes troubleshooting guide
- **SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md** - Executive summary of the tool compatibility fix
  - Problem description and root cause
  - Solution details
  - Testing instructions

### Documentation
- Clarified that ALL Factory models support ALL tools when using Task delegation
- Explained Factory's pattern: undefined `tools` = all tools available
- Added references to official Factory.ai documentation

## [2.2.0] - 2025-11-10

  - Clear instructions for API keys

### ✨ Impact

**Before this release:**
- No runtime configuration (assumed Bun installed)
- config.yml tracked in git (security risk)
- README was 1,230 lines (overwhelming)
- Only Linear API key supported
- MCP setup only via Factory CLI

**After this release:**
- ✅ Runtime configurable (Bun/npm/pnpm/yarn) with auto-fallback
- ✅ API keys never committed (config.yml gitignored)
- ✅ README 35% shorter and 5-year-old friendly
- ✅ All three API keys supported (Linear, Exa, Ref)
- ✅ MCP setup via config.yml (easier method)
- ✅ Complete security guide included
- ✅ 4 clear paths for all scenarios

### 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Better Performance**: Bun support provides 3-10x speed improvement
2. **More Secure**: API keys never committed, comprehensive security guide
3. **Easier to Understand**: README refactored for maximum clarity
4. **More Flexible**: Support for all runtimes and all MCP services
5. **Better Onboarding**: Clear decision tree and step-by-step paths

### 🔒 Security Improvements

- config.yml automatically gitignored
- config.example.yml provides safe template
- API_KEYS_SETUP.md guides secure practices
- Emergency procedures for leaked keys
- Team collaboration best practices
- Key rotation documentation

### ⚡ Performance Improvements

- Bun runtime: 3-10x faster script execution
- Clear performance messaging in README
- Automatic detection and fallback
- User choice preserved (can use npm/node)

- **Added comprehensive MCP tools to ALL droids** - orchestrator and all specialists now have access to:
  - **Linear MCP**: Direct issue management, commenting, project/team access
  - **Exa Search**: Web and code context research capabilities
  - **Ref Documentation**: Public and private documentation search
  - **Code Execution**: TypeScript execution for MCP server interactions
  - **Desktop Commander**: Advanced file operations and process management
- **Autonomous tool usage** - Droids now use MCP tools automatically without needing permission
