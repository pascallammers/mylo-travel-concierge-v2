# Droidz Product Vision

## Mission

Transform Claude Code into the ultimate development powerhouse through spec-driven, parallel execution, making complex software development 3-5x faster while maintaining quality and consistency.

## Vision Statement

Droidz empowers developers to tackle ambitious projects with confidence by orchestrating specialized AI agents in isolated workspaces, each following rigorous standards and working in perfect parallel harmony.

## Core Principles

### 1. Spec-Driven Development
Every feature starts with a clear specification. No code is written without understanding the "why" and "how."

### 2. Parallel Execution
Independent tasks run simultaneously in isolated git worktrees, dramatically reducing development time.

### 3. Specialist Expertise
Each agent is a specialist in its domain (codegen, testing, infrastructure, integration, refactoring), ensuring high-quality output.

### 4. Supervised Autonomy
Agents work autonomously within approval gates, combining speed with human oversight.

### 5. Standards-First
All code follows documented patterns and best practices, automatically enforced across all agents.

## Product Goals

### Short Term (Q1 2025)
- ✅ Initialize memory system for context persistence
- ✅ Fix all agent configurations for Claude Code compatibility
- ✅ Build working orchestrator with tmux-based parallel execution
- ✅ Create `/orchestrate` command for user-friendly invocation
- 🚧 Implement spec-driven workflow
- 🚧 Build auto-activating skills for seamless experience

### Medium Term (Q2 2025)
- Build MCP server for advanced worktree management
- Integrate Linear for automatic ticket processing
- Create comprehensive onboarding experience
- Develop debugging and monitoring tools
- Build spec template library for common patterns

### Long Term (2025+)
- Distributed execution across multiple machines
- AI-powered conflict resolution
- Automatic code review and quality gates
- Integration with more project management tools
- Community-contributed specialist agents and specs

## Target Users

### Primary
**Solo Developers & Small Teams**
- Building complex applications quickly
- Need structure but want flexibility
- Value automation but require control
- Want to learn best practices

### Secondary
**Open Source Maintainers**
- Managing multiple concurrent PRs
- Need consistent code quality
- Want to scale contribution processing

### Tertiary
**Development Agencies**
- Building client projects rapidly
- Need standardized workflows
- Require quality assurance

## Key Differentiators

1. **True Parallel Execution** - Not just concurrent agents, but isolated git worktrees
2. **Spec-Driven Workflow** - Clear planning before implementation
3. **Supervised Mode** - Human approval gates at critical points
4. **Memory System** - Context persists across sessions
5. **Standards Integration** - 8 framework templates built-in
6. **Hybrid Activation** - Both manual and automatic triggering

## Success Metrics

- **Velocity**: 3-5x faster on multi-task initiatives
- **Quality**: 90%+ test coverage on generated code
- **Adoption**: Growing community of contributors
- **Reliability**: <5% orchestration failures
- **User Satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score >50

## Non-Goals

- ❌ Replacing human developers (augmentation, not replacement)
- ❌ Fully autonomous coding with no oversight
- ❌ Supporting all frameworks (focused on quality over quantity)
- ❌ Enterprise-only features (remain open source friendly)
- ❌ Compromising code quality for speed

## Future Possibilities

### Agent Marketplace
Community-contributed specialists for niche domains (ML, blockchain, mobile, etc.)

### Cross-Project Learning
Agents learn patterns from your entire codebase portfolio

### Predictive Orchestration
AI predicts which tasks to parallelize based on project history

### Collaborative Agents
Multiple agents working together on single complex tasks

### Visual Orchestration Dashboard
Real-time monitoring of all parallel agents with rich UI
