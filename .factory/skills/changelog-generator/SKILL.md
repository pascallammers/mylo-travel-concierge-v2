# Changelog Generator

Auto-generates CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format from git history.

## When This Activates

- User says: "update changelog", "generate release notes", "create changelog"
- Before creating a new release/version
- When preparing for deployment

## Changelog Format

Follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) standard:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Process

1. **Get git commits since last release:**
   ```bash
   git log v1.1.0..HEAD --oneline --no-merges
   ```

2. **Parse conventional commits:**
   - `feat:` → **Added** section
   - `fix:` → **Fixed** section
   - `refactor:` → **Changed** section
   - `perf:` → **Changed** section
   - `docs:` → (not in changelog, internal)
   - `style:` → (not in changelog)
   - `test:` → (not in changelog)
   - `chore:` → (not in changelog, unless notable)
   - `BREAKING CHANGE:` → **Changed** (with warning)

3. **Group by category:**
   - Added (new features)
   - Changed (modifications to existing)
   - Deprecated (will be removed)
   - Removed (features removed)
   - Fixed (bug fixes)
   - Security (security fixes)

4. **Link to PRs/issues:**
   ```markdown
   - User authentication with JWT tokens (#123, @username)
   ```

5. **Add version comparison links**

## Semantic Versioning

Auto-suggest version bump:

| Change Type | Version Bump | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `feat:` | MINOR (1.1.0 → 1.2.0) | New features |
| `fix:` | PATCH (1.1.0 → 1.1.1) | Bug fixes |
| `BREAKING CHANGE` | MAJOR (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) | Breaking changes |
| `perf:`, `refactor:` | PATCH/MINOR | Improvements |

**Suggest:** "Based on commits, suggest version: 1.2.0 (MINOR - new features added)"

## Migration Guides

For breaking changes, auto-generate migration guide:

```markdown
## Migration Guide: v1.1.0 → v1.2.0

### Breaking Changes

#### API Response Format Changed

**Before:**
\`\`\`json
{ "id": "123", "name": "John" }
\`\`\`

**After:**
\`\`\`json
{ "userId": "123", "name": "John" }
\`\`\`

**Action Required:**
Replace all instances of \`response.id\` with \`response.userId\` in your code.

**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes
```

## Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Update before each release
- Group related changes
- Link to PR numbers
- Mention breaking changes prominently
- Include migration guides
- Use clear, user-friendly language

❌ **DON'T:**
- Include every tiny commit
- Use technical jargon
- Skip breaking change warnings
- Forget version comparison links
- Make it too verbose

## Automation

```bash
# Generate changelog for next version
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline --no-merges

# Or use conventional-changelog
npx conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s

# Update version in package.json
npm version minor  # or: patch, major
```

**Generate changelog, present to user, update CHANGELOG.md with approval.**
