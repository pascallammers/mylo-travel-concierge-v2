# .droidz directory - Local state and specifications
#
# This directory contains:
# - specs/ - Generated feature specifications
# - tasks/ - Task tracking (future feature)
# - architecture.md - Project architecture (future feature)
# - project.json - Project metadata (future feature)
#
# DEFAULT BEHAVIOR: Ignore all generated content
# This is git-ignored by default to keep your local state private.
#
# OPTIONAL: Commit specs as project documentation
# If you want to version-control your specifications:
# 1. Comment out the line below
# 2. Commit individual spec files to share with team
#
# Example:
#   # Ignore all by default
#   *
#   # But track example specs
#   !specs/000-*.md
#   # And specific specs you want to share
#   !specs/001-user-authentication.md

# Ignore everything in .droidz/ by default
*

# EXCEPT: Track the .gitignore file itself
!.gitignore

# EXCEPT: Track the example spec (for documentation)
!specs/
!specs/000-*.md
