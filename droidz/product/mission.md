## Problem Statement

### Pain Points We Solve

1. **Complex Award Booking**: Finding award availability across multiple loyalty programs is time-consuming and requires expertise
2. **Information Overload**: Travelers spend hours comparing flights, prices, and loyalty program options
3. **Missed Opportunities**: Users often pay cash for flights when award seats are available
4. **Fragmented Research**: Travel research requires multiple tools, tabs, and sources
5. **Premium Access Barriers**: Business and First Class travel seems inaccessible to everyday travelers

### The Gap in the Market

Traditional flight search engines focus on paid fares. Loyalty program websites are siloed and difficult to navigate. There's no unified, intelligent assistant that helps travelers maximize their points and miles while providing comprehensive travel intelligence.
